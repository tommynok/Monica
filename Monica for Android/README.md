## 📖 Overview

**Monica for Android** is not just a password manager; it's a comprehensive digital vault built with the latest Android technologies. It prioritizes **data sovereignty**—your data is encrypted locally using military-grade algorithms and never touches a cloud server unless *you* configure it to do so (via WebDAV).

With a stunning **Material You** interface, seamless **Autofill** integration, and advanced features like **KeePass support** and **TOTP generation**, Monica brings desktop-class power to your mobile device.

*   **Your Cloud, Your Rules**: Sync securely across devices using any **WebDAV** provider (Nextcloud, Synology, JianguoYun, etc.).
*   **Encrypted Backups**: Backups are packed into ZIP files and can be optionally **double-encrypted** with AES-256-GCM, rendering them useless to anyone but you.

## 🔒 Security Architecture

We take security seriously. Here is how your data is protected:

1.  **Encryption Key**: Your master password acts as the key to unlock the vault. It is hashed using **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** with 100,000+ iterations.
2.  **Algorithm**: The database is encrypted using **AES-256** in **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)**, preventing both reading and tampering (integrity attacks).
3.  **Hardware Security**: The encryption keys are wrapped by the **Android Keystore System** (TEE/SE), making them extraction-resistant even on rooted devices.
4.  **Privacy**:
    *   No Internet Permissions (except for WebDAV sync which you control).
    *   Screenshot blocking in secure views.
    *   Auto-lock on app switching or timeout.
