Monica is a local password vault that aggregates **Bitwarden** and **KeePass**.
It is built around local-first storage and helps you manage passwords, 2FA, secure notes, and sensitive attachments across Android and browser clients.

> Monica for Windows is archived. Historical code: [Monica-for-Windows](https://github.com/JoyinJoester/Monica-for-Windows)
>
> Monica for Browser is archived. The new Monica Extension is currently being rewritten and under active development — stay tuned.
>
> Since the project is currently maintained mostly by me alone, both time and bandwidth are limited. Because of that, Monica for Wear cannot be updated continuously for the time being. My current focus will stay on improving features, experience, and stability for Monica for Android. Thanks for your understanding and support.

## User First

### Who Monica is for
- Users who want local-first password management instead of fully hosted cloud storage.
- Users who work with both Bitwarden data and KeePass (`.kdbx`) files.
- Users who need Android daily usage and browser autofill at the same time.

### What you get
- Encrypted local vault for logins, cards, identity data, notes, and attachments.
- Dual ecosystem integration: Android includes Bitwarden API/sync capability and KeePass (`.kdbx`) read/write support.
- Optional sync/backup through your own WebDAV infrastructure.
- Built-in TOTP management in the same app.

### MDBX local database format
MDBX is Monica's local-first encrypted vault format in progress. It is not just a password table; it is designed around nested folders, attachments, commit history, conflict detection, tombstone-based deletion, snapshot recovery, and Tiga security modes.

If you want to integrate MDBX in another client, start with the [MDBX workspace README](mdbx/README.en.md) and the [MDBX client integration guide](mdbx/CLIENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md). The full format specification lives in [mdbx/docs](mdbx/docs/README.md).

### Quick install

Android:
1. Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/Monica-Pass/Monica-for-Android/releases).
2. Install on Android 8.0+ and initialize your master password.

Browser extension (Chrome / Edge):
1. Build from `Monica for Browser`.
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` and enable Developer mode.
3. Load unpacked and choose the `dist` folder.

### Known limitation
- Due to system compatibility constraints, Monica for Android currently cannot create passkeys on some Xiaomi HyperOS devices. You can try [HyperMonica](https://github.com/Wuming155/HyperMonica), a workaround module contributed by a Coolapk community member.

## Android Focus

### Core capabilities
- Local vault for credential storage.
- Aggregated import/integration with KeePass and Bitwarden.
- Fast search by title, domain, and tags.
- Biometric unlock with Android system capability.
- Unified TOTP storage and generation.

### Implementation details
- UI: Jetpack Compose + Material 3 + Navigation Compose.
- Data: Room (`PasswordDatabase`) + DAO + Repository.
- Concurrency: Kotlin Coroutines + Flow.
- DI: Koin (initialized in `MonicaApplication`).
- Security: Android Keystore, EncryptedSharedPreferences, BiometricPrompt.
- Background tasks: WorkManager (`AutoBackupWorker`) for automatic WebDAV backup.
- Protocols and integrations: Retrofit + OkHttp (Bitwarden API), kotpass (KeePass), sardine-android (WebDAV).

### Security model
- Encryption: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption).
- KDF: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (high iteration parameters).
- Local protection: master password hash and security settings are managed locally.
- Network boundary: the app declares network permissions, mainly for Bitwarden integration and WebDAV sync/backup.
